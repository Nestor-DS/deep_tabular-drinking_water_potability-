# Deep Tabular Learning Project for Water Quality

This project focuses on applying deep learning methods to tabular datasets related to water quality. Different approaches are used for data exploration, classification with Random Forests, and deep learning techniques.

## Project Structure

- **dataExploration**: Modules and notebooks related to data exploration.
  - `exploration/data_exploration.py`: Script for data exploration.
  - `exploration/RandomForestClassifier.py`: Implementation of the Random Forest classifier.

  Notebooks:
  - `I-I(data_exploration).ipynb`: Detailed exploration of the dataset.
  - `II-I(RandomForestClassifier).ipynb`: Implementation and evaluation of Random Forests.

- **deep_tabular**: Notebooks related to deep tabular learning.
  - `I-I(hypercubes).ipynb`: Development of hypernetworks and models.
  - `I-II(Optimization).ipynb`: Model optimization.
  - `I-III(MetricsEvaluation).ipynb`: Evaluation of model metrics.

- `dptI-I.ipynb`: Main notebook for overall project execution.
- `drinking_water_potability.csv`: Dataset on water potability.
- `impute_data.py`: Script for data imputation.

## Usage

1. Use the main notebook `dptI-I.ipynb` to start the project.

## Dependencies

Make sure to have the following Python libraries installed:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow (for deep learning)
